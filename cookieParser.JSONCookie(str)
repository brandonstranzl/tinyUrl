cookieParser.JSONCookie(str)
Parse a cookie value as a JSON cookie. This will return the parsed JSON value if it was a JSON cookie, otherwise it will return the passed value.

cookieParser.JSONCookies(cookies)
Given an object, this will iterate over the keys and call JSONCookie on each value, replacing the original value with the parsed value. This returns the same object that was passed in.
